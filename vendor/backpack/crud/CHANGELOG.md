## [0.8.7] - 2015-09-17

## [0.8.5] - 2015-09-11

## [0.8.4] - 2015-09-10

### Added
- allTranslations() method on CrudTrait, to easily get all connected entities;


## [0.8.3] - 2015-09-10

### Added
- withFakes() method on CrudTrait, to easily get entities with fakes fields;

## [0.8.1] - 2015-09-09

### Added
- CRUD Alias for handling the routes. Now instead of defining a Route::resource() and a bunch of other routes if you need reorder/translations etc, you only define CRUD:resource() instead (same syntax) and the CrudServiceProvider will define all the routes you need. That, of course, if you define 'CRUD' => 'Dick\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider' in your config/app.php file, under 'aliases'.


## [0.8.0] - 2015-09-09

### Added
- CRUD Multi-language editing. If the EntityCrudController's "details_row" is set to true, by default the CRUD will output the translations for that entity's row. Tested and working add, edit, delete and reordering both for original rows and for translation rows.


## [0.7.9] - 2015-09-09

### Added
- CRUD Details Row functionality: if enabled, it will show a + sign for each row. When clicked, an AJAX call will return the showDetailsRow() method on the controller and place it in a row right below the current one; Currently that method just dumps the entry; But hey, it works.


## [0.7.8] - 2015-09-08

### Fixed
- In CRUD reordering, the leaf ID was outputted for debuging.


## [0.7.7] - 2015-09-08

### Added
- New field type: page_or_link; It's used in the MenuManager package, but can be used in any other model;


## [0.7.4] - 2015-09-08

### Added
- Actually started using CHANGELOG.md to track modifications.

### Fixed
- Reordering echo algorithm. It now takes account of leaf order.
