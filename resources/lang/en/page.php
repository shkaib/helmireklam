<p><br>Concerned about the quality of our website, we regularly monitor the broadcast ads.
However, we realized that bad people use our site to upload fictitious ads and attempting to extort money. We recommend the greater vis-à-vis the following cases caution, this is most certainly attempted fraud:</p>

<ul class="list list-circle" style="padding: 10px 20px 0 20px;">
<li>The item for sale is abroad (Italy, France, United Kingdom...) and the "so-called" seller offers to ship the property to test before purchase subject to the payment of a deposit. Beware, the well is likely to never reach you.</li>
<li>The "so-called" seller pretends to the Consumer Service of our site and certify potential purchasers that the site has controlled the quality of the property to sell, the veracity of the information and documents provided by the seller. Systematically refuse any payment of money that you would be asked the name of our site. We do not interfere in any way as an intermediary or trusted third party in transactions between buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>A buyer wants to pay with PayPal, Kwixo or other payment service or online transfer and asks you to create an account. After you create your PayPal account, for example, you received a payment confirmation by email. Before sending the object of purchase, log into your PayPal account and check that you received money to your PayPal balance. Beware of emails. Some fraudsters send fake emails PayPal to push you to ship a package when you have not received payment. Check the email address of origin: if the prefix reminds the payment service and the domain name is a free webmail (eg service.paypal@gmail.com) and not an address of the payment service in question ( eg service@paypal.com) is an attempted fraud. Néamoins, the balance in your PayPal account is always the best proof that the sale goes well.</li>
<li>You just received an email letting you know that your account will be suspended. This email comes in any case our services. This is a phishing attempt, be careful and never send your bank details.</li>
<li>You just received an email asking you to enter your credit card details following the purchase of the option Urgent logo. This email comes in any case our services. This is a phishing attempt, be careful and never send your bank details.</li>
<li>If you receive an email from PayPal asking you to recharge your account with a PCS card, we advise you not to proceed with the transaction.</li>
<li>The payment of the property you wish to buy or sell can be made only by money order, Western Union, PCS Mastercard, Ticket Premium or Moneygram? These payment methods are not secure and may well be fake. We recommend using the most secure payment methods.</li>
<li>The buyer is temporarily abroad and offers to send you the money by money order or Western Union to reserve your property. You will receive an email notification of the payment service or an email from the buyer asking you to verify that your payment has been made on a fake website of La Poste or Western Union. Attention, if the site URL or email address you seems doubtful, it is an attempted fraud.</li>
<li>MSN contact request a service: place an ad on our site. In reality, this person has hacked the MSN account to your contact and trying to get you file a fraudulent ad. Never place ad instead of someone else. If you have already validated the announcement, thank you to send us the coordinates with which the announcement was made.</li>
